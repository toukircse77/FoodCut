				  <p>A food ingredient is any substance that is added to a food to achieve a desired effect.  Direct food additives are used in foods to impart specific technological or functional qualities. For example, stabilizers are used to help prevent separation of nutrients in milk products, while phosphates are used as a leavening agent in baked goods. Indirect additives are not intentionally added to food, but may be present in trace amounts as a result of processing, packaging, shipping or storage. Both direct and indirect food additives are controlled by national regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  Any food ingredient must be proven safe to be used in foods.</p>

      <p>I usually tell most people to start by learning HTML and CSS, then move into learning JavaScript. The reason is that JavaScript is used everywhere: frontend, backend, and even to build mobile apps. It has many use cases, which is why I think it’s smart to learn.</p>

      <p>If you have an interest in coding and graphic design, then there’s nothing to say you shouldn’t learn skills in both areas. They often work hand-in-hand, so having knowledge and skills in both areas could be desirable for certain career paths. You could also think about pursuing something in between like UI design, which is a very in-demand career right now!
        <br><br>
        In general, having design skills along with coding skills is helpful. But it’s also okay to do one over the other. My advice would be to just get started! You can always change directions later… as long as you’re changing directions to the final destination you’re looking for!

      <p>Now, in 2020, it’s a no-brainer: Python 3 is definitely the way to go. There are still some situations where picking up Python 2 might be advantageous, or you may just want to learn a little of the history and the differences between Python 2 and 3 for curiosity’s sake, but job-wise, Python 3 is the clear winner.</p>

      <p>Personally, I’d say choose a path and stick to it! Learning too many things at once will slow you down. Here are a few ideas of things you can choose to focus on, and a little bit about each one.</p>
